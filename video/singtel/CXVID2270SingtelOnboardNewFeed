<p>â€œSome of these hearsay and anecdotes may be well-meaning but (are) misinformed. In fact, quite a number are really not verified,â€ she told TODAY in an hour-long interview at Kampung Admiralty Hawker Centre on Friday (Nov 16).</p>

<p>The Governmentâ€™s stock-take of the social enterprise-run hawker centre model is also not a knee-jerk reaction, as the authorities always intended to â€œrefine and improve the model as we go alongâ€, she said.</p>

<p>The stock-take was announced about a month ago, after a series of complaints from hawkers and observers about unreasonable contractual terms and high ancillary costs.</p>

<p>The National Environment Agency (NEA), which oversees hawker centres, has announced several moves over the past two weeks to mitigate these concerns at seven new hawker centres.</p>

<p>In Singapore, 13 out of 114 hawker centres islandwide are managed by five social enterprise entities. Seven of the 13 centres are new, built after the Government announced in 2011 that it would restart the hawker centre building programme.</p>

<p>When asked if the authorities were aware of complaints before they were highlighted by hawkers and observers â€” such as consultant and entrepreneur K F Seetoh of Makansutra â€” Dr Khor would only reiterate that the NEA wanted to â€œset broad parametersâ€ to begin with and â€œmove in quicklyâ€ to address any issues that arose.</p>

<p>Operators were given some flexibility to implement innovative ideas, based on their experience in the food and beverage industry.</p>

<p>â€œSome of these are quite recent issues and we are working on it. The fact is we have worked very quickly to address them,â€ she said.</p>

<p>Having more formal feedback sessions with hawkers can help, she added, rather than having â€œmisinformation, anecdotes, hearsayâ€ making the rounds.</p>

<p>All five social enterprise operators â€” Fei Siong Food Management, NTUC Foodfare, Timbre Group, Hawker Management under Koufu, and OTHM under Kopitiam â€” have formed hawkersâ€™ feedback groups in the hawker centres they manage, with at least one feedback session conducted in each centre so far.</p>

<p>Dr Khor added that the stock-take â€œwill take a little whileâ€. Some other areas the NEA is looking at are the selection criteria for operators, and what the authorities can leave to market forces.</p>

<p><strong>ADDRESSING MISINFORMATION</strong></p>

<p>While the authorities â€œappreciate the passionate conversations and discussionsâ€ about the hawker industry, Dr Khor said she wanted to address some misinformation â€” on rental and operating costs, budget meals and the deal that hawkers are getting â€” that â€œis really quite concerningâ€.</p>

<p>There have been claims that monthly rentals at social enterprise-run hawker centres are â€œastronomical and exorbitantâ€, she noted.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Dr Khor pointed out that the median monthly rent at the seven new hawker centres is S$2,000, while the median rent at comparable existing NEA-run hawker centres â€” based on location and amenities â€” is about S$1,700 a month.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The slightly higher figure accounts for the fact that the seven centres are new and better-designed, with stallholders able to benefit from larger stalls, better frontage, amenities and facilities, she explained.</p>

<p>The NEA also chooses operators that charge lower rentals and operating costs in their tender bids to run the new hawker centres. Operators are not allowed to change these costs during the hawkersâ€™ tenancies, and have to get NEAâ€™s approval to introduce additional charges.</p>

<p>â€œEven when we assess tenders and look at rentals, we also use guides from professional valuers. They assess fair market rent. They also look at tendered rent for existing hawker centres,â€ Dr Khor said.</p>

<p>On the issue of ancillary operating costs, Dr Khor said that those who compare the operating costs of existing NEA-managed hawker centres to those at new hawker centres are â€œnot comparing apples to applesâ€.</p>

<p>The average monthly operating cost at existing hawker centres comes up to about S$600 while at new hawker centres, it is S$1,500. Dr Khor explained that the former only accounts for table-cleaning and service and conservancy charges.</p>

<p>Throw in dishwashing costs, which could run up to S$1,500 if hawkers employ an assistant for the task, and total operating costs at older hawker centres could go up to about S$2,100.</p>

<p>The S$1,500 average monthly operating cost at new hawker centres, however, already takes into account table-cleaning, service and conservancy, and centralised dishwashing costs.</p>

<p>â€œSo I think (thereâ€™s) really quite a lot of misunderstanding and misinformation. Somebody just took one piece of information and said, rental is this, operating cost is this for existing centres, and itâ€™s so low compared to social enterprise hawker centres. But they never said that the operating cost (for existing centres) doesnâ€™t include dishwashing, which the stallholder has to do,â€ Dr Khor said.</p>

<p>Another area she highlighted was â€œthis idea that we are forcing hawkers to sell their food at very low pricesâ€ â€” that is, at S$3 or less.</p>

<p>The reality is that hawkers are asked to sell only one budget meal priced at S$3 or less, and can price other dishes differently, she said.</p>

<p>â€œWe are not artificially forcing the food prices of these hawkers to be low. We are just saying, â€˜Sell one dish that is affordable and price the rest reasonablyâ€™. There is also a social objective of hawker centres and itâ€™s to provide affordable food, but itâ€™s not to the extent that hawkers cannot make a decent living,â€ she stressed.</p>

<p>She also tackled the notion that â€œoperators are exploiting hawkers and that the Government does not care for hawkersâ€.</p>

<p>The Government has had the interests of hawkers in mind from the start, she said, pointing out that they require all the operators to plough back at least half of their operating surplus into the hawker centre for the benefit of the community. Operators also have to propose in their tender bids how they want to do so, such as giving meal vouchers to lower-income residents.</p>

<p>Asked if the NEA checks whether they follow through on their proposals, Dr Khor would only say that the agency regularly meets operators. Operators are required to submit their audited statements annually to the NEA.</p>

<p>Correcting an impression created that â€œall our hawkers are not doing well, especially at social enterprise hawker centresâ€, Dr Khor said: â€œThe reality is that many are doing well. Of course we can do more to help the centres which are still new and struggling and building up.â€</p>

<p>Yishun Park Hawker Centre, for example, which ran into some controversy over its tray return scheme when it opened late last year, â€œis doing all rightâ€.</p>

<p>The NEA has been working with its operator, Timbre Group, to â€œfacilitate programmes and innovationsâ€ that have increased footfall, she said.</p>

<p>â€œI think we cannot assume that once we build a hawker centre, it will be viable, it will do well. We need time to build this up, especially if theyâ€™re not in prime or very good locations, and thatâ€™s the reality,â€ she added.</p>

<p>Some regulations are needed at the new hawker centres, such as the number of hours and days that hawkers should open their stalls, she said.</p>

<p>This is to ensure the vibrancy of the hawker centre.</p>

<p>Many existing centres have anchor hawkers that bring consistent footfall, but new centres do not, she noted.</p>

<p>On some hawkers not necessarily understanding their contracts before signing them, she noted that during the stock-take, the NEA got operators to agree to explain the tenancy agreements to new hawkers in â€œsimple termsâ€ before they sign.</p>

<p>â€œOf course, in retrospect, the terms that we got the operators to agree to change, I think that is good because it allayed concerns that if this is in writing, people will be worried even though it may not actually be imposed,â€ she said.</p>

<p><strong>â€˜COMMITTEES LISTENED TO HAWKERSâ€™</strong></p>

<p>On criticism of the composition of the Hawker Centres Consultation Panel and Hawker 3.0 Committee, Dr Khor said its members had conducted â€œextensive consultationsâ€ with hawkers.</p>

<p>The consultation panel was formed in 2011 to provide ideas on new hawker centres, while the 3.0 Committee proposed ways in 2017 to improve hawker centres and promote the trade.</p>

<p>Some have pointed out that both the panel and committee were made up mainly of people who do not have direct experience with hawker centres.</p>

<p>â€œYou cannot just look at the committee itself because there will always be outreach and testing of ideas and so on,â€ Dr Khor said.</p>

<p>â€œWe had people in the committee who were able to provide ideas on how to nurture, train people, behavioural studies, how to get people to be more graciousâ€¦ We had suppliers of equipment (in the 3.0 committee) and so on to see how to reduce manual workload.â€</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Dr Khor was coy about whether all hawker centres will eventually come under the social enterprise management model.</p>

<p>Some hawkers previously told TODAY that rumours have been going around.</p>

<p>â€œThis new model, we are still refining and looking at how to improve it. Itâ€™s premature to have any stance on it,â€ she said.</p>

<p>The seven new hawker centres will continue being managed by social enterprises â€œbecause itâ€™s achieved good outcomesâ€.</p>

<p>â€œAs and when the other new hawker centres come up, we will look at how exactly we will manage them,â€ she said.</p>

<p>Even after he started working and was earning a comfortable salary of over S$6,000 a month, Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) graduate Gautam Param did not give up on it.</p>

<p>In fact, as a management consultant, he travelled overseas frequently and would sometimes rely on meal replacement powders to keep him going through the day.</p>

<p>After a chance encounter with an old schoolmate last year, the duo decided to turn the idea into reality. The result is Sustenance, which is vegan and contains ingredients such as fruits, vegetables, grains and legumes that have been freeze-dried and pulverised.</p>

<p>Freeze-drying, a technology used to feed astronauts in space, involves bringing food temperatures down to as low as -40Â°C before light heating, said Mr Gautam, 27, who graduated in 2015. This removes the moisture of the ingredients but locks in the nutrients and extends the shelf life without the use of preservatives, he said.</p>

<p>His business partner, Mr Raymond Yeong, graduated in engineering product development and was working as an analyst at the same company.</p>

<p>Mr Yeong, 27, had tried to lose weight. He tried meal replacement products, but said: "They don't sit well with me for a lot of reasons, like the very artificial taste."</p>

<p>Several discussions later, the pair decided to take their project to the mass market.</p>

<p>They experimented with various combinations of freeze-dried ingredients ordered from the United States, and served them to friends who eventually started saying, "stop coming back", quipped Mr Yeong.</p>

<p>After spending more than S$10,000 from their savings and from Mr Gautam's former boss to perfect the recipe, they launched Sustenance this year.</p>

<p>The product joins at least one other local meal replacement brand launched within the last two years. Lembas, founded by entrepreneur Alvin Chong, was previously known as zoylent and contains soy, coconut and oats. Lembas is Mr Chong's version of Soylent, a meal replacement drink from the United States popular with tech workers.</p>

<p>A single 300 calorie meal sachet costs S$8.90, while a 30-meal option costs S$231, or S$7.70 per sachet. Listed ingredients include oats, wheatgrass, acai berries, chia seeds, brown rice protein and alfalfa leaves.</p>

<p>Customers include white-collar workers who are constantly on the move.</p>

<p>In the last three months, Sustenance sold more than 1,000 sachets per month.</p>

<p>Mr Gautam reckoned he is earning about a-third compared to his previous job, but said he finds it meaningful to produce "something of value for the masses".</p>

<p>"It takes years to build up a brand, establish trust and have a big customer base. So I'm happy that we're already profitable within a year of starting up," he said.</p>

<p>He called Singapore, a nation used to savouring its food, a "tough market" but said the product suits a small but growing group. "Besides special occasions and nights out, they think of food as something functional that they need to eat to keep healthy. These guys are looking for something healthy but convenient," said Mr Gautam, who said Sustenance does not contain synthetic ingredients.</p>

<p>Mr Yeong splits his time between the start-up and his day job as a project manager at an engineering firm.</p>

<p>Besides the Singapore market, Sustenance is testing the waters in China.</p>

<p>Mr Gautam and Mr Yeong were in Guangzhou in August for a roadshow, and intend to hold another one in Beijing in December to see if they should take the plunge.</p>

<p>"China is the fastest growing vegan marketâ€¦ and health products that are imported are held in higher regard than the local ones," said Mr Gautam, citing several health scares from tainted products in the country previously.</p>

<p>He said the response in Guangzhou was positive, considering the cost of a meal in China is lower than the price of 40 Chinese yuan (S$8) for a Sustenance sachet.</p>

<p>Even after he started working and was earning a comfortable salary of over S$6,000 a month, Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) graduate Gautam Param did not give up on it.</p>

<p>In fact, as a management consultant, he travelled overseas frequently and would sometimes rely on meal replacement powders to keep him going through the day.</p>

<p>After a chance encounter with an old schoolmate last year, the duo decided to turn the idea into reality. The result is Sustenance, which is vegan and contains ingredients such as fruits, vegetables, grains and legumes that have been freeze-dried and pulverised.</p>

<p>Freeze-drying, a technology used to feed astronauts in space, involves bringing food temperatures down to as low as -40Â°C before light heating, said Mr Gautam, 27, who graduated in 2015. This removes the moisture of the ingredients but locks in the nutrients and extends the shelf life without the use of preservatives, he said.</p>

<p>His business partner, Mr Raymond Yeong, graduated in engineering product development and was working as an analyst at the same company.</p>

<p>Mr Yeong, 27, had tried to lose weight. He tried meal replacement products, but said: "They don't sit well with me for a lot of reasons, like the very artificial taste."</p>

<p>Several discussions later, the pair decided to take their project to the mass market.</p>

<p>They experimented with various combinations of freeze-dried ingredients ordered from the United States, and served them to friends who eventually started saying, "stop coming back", quipped Mr Yeong.</p>

<p>After spending more than S$10,000 from their savings and from Mr Gautam's former boss to perfect the recipe, they launched Sustenance this year.</p>

<p>The product joins at least one other local meal replacement brand launched within the last two years. Lembas, founded by entrepreneur Alvin Chong, was previously known as zoylent and contains soy, coconut and oats. Lembas is Mr Chong's version of Soylent, a meal replacement drink from the United States popular with tech workers.</p>

<p>That's my jetlagged verdict after disembarking from Singapore Airlines's flight SQ22, the return of the carrier's Changi-to-Newark journey after a five-year hiatus.</p>

<p>The final quarter of the 16,700km trek was tedious, I must say. By hour 14, somewhere over Canada, the fancy new plane (Airbus SE's A350-900 Ultra Long Range) was starting to feel like a luxurious prison.</p>

<p>My skin was parched, and I couldn't help trying to think of other scenarios in which that many people in a confined space would collectively go so long without a shower.</p>

<p>Even the thought of another mimosa couldn't get me enthusiastic about still being airborne.</p>

<p>But travelling to the world's opposite time zone is never going to be entirely painless.</p>

<p>Doing it in business class â€” and there are no economy seats on this almost 18-hour flight â€” reduces a lot of the trauma.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="media-image attr__typeof__foaf:Image img__fid__20073751 img__view_mode__media_original attr__format__media_original" height="1200" src="http://todayonlistg2.prod.acquia-sites.com/sites/default/files/sia_nyc2.jpg" typeof="foaf:Image" width="1600" /></p>

<p>And in comparison with the other options to get from Singapore to the Big Apple â€” flying via hubs in North Asia, Europe, or the US West Coast â€” this route is definitely preferable. I will choose it for New York work trips from now on.</p>

<p>Here's what a coddled business traveller needs to know.</p>

<p>PLANNING</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Starting next week, flights will depart daily from Singapore late in the evening local time, and leave Newark for the return journey at mid-morning. This means you need to stay another night in the New York area compared with Singapore Air's flight with the Frankfurt layover, which departs John F. Kennedy International Airport in the evening.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>SQ22 cuts about five hours off the trip compared with the route through Germany, which includes a layover of about two hours. More importantly, not having to get off the plane gives you more flexibility on when you sleep, eat and work. I stayed up for the first meal and fell asleep around 2.30am Singapore time or 2.30pm in New York, slightly closer to the time zone where I was going.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Booking a standard-fare Singapore-Newark round-trip ticket in business class, leaving on Dec 1 and returning a week later, costs about S$11,000. Premium economy costs about S$3,000.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>THE CABIN</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Regular Singapore Airlines business-class fliers will recognise the 67 comfortable and stylish seats from the regular A350-900s, which ply routes including Singapore-Melbourne and Singapore-San Francisco.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>They're spacious, though not excessively so, with a width of 28 inches. The pitch â€” the distance between a point on a seat and the same point on the seat in front of it â€” is 1.5m, and the seat flips forward to convert into a 1.98m bed. You can keep a small bag near your feet and there's a storage bin in the right hand console, as well as another next to the in-flight entertainment screen.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>I was in seat 12D. I would recommend booking as far forward in the first business class cabin as possible â€” being near the front galley is a minor issue as most of the food and drink service is conducted from the middle one. The middle front-row seats (11D and 11F) have more leg space, and those are my top picks if you can live without a window seat. Row 19 at the front of the second cabin has the same benefit, though that is also where the bassinets are located, so proceed at your own peril.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>When it's time to sleep, the addition of a mattress topper makes the bed noticeably more comfortable than the same seat on other routes. The foot cubby remains quite small though, and sleeping on a diagonal angle feels a little weird. That said, I managed 6.5 hours of almost continuous rest (only disrupted by turbulence), and felt good when I woke up.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The cabin ambience was pleasant, with subtle lighting and relatively low noise levels. Not having overhead bins above the middle seats in business class gives an airy feel. The carrier says the air quality is better due to "a more optimised cabin altitude and humidity levels". But I'm not sure. While my eyes didn't feel as gritty as they usually do after long-haul flights, my skin still suffered.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Gripes: There's no skybar/lounge, and the space around the galleys is too tight to stand and stretch without getting in the way. Bathrooms are small and quite spartan. There's only four for the business-class cabins, and three for the 94 seats in premium economy. So when everyone wants to change into and out of their (self-supplied!) sleepwear, be prepared to wait.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>FOOD</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Supper, served about an hour and a half after take-off, was a main with fruit as a dessert. I had the lobster thermidor from the Book the Cook menu for its nostalgia and novelty value. (It's pretty tasty, even though it fails on every diet front.) This needs to be ordered 24 hours before the flight. The on-board options included pan-seared snapper fillet and steamed lobster dumplings in superior soup.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The showstopper main meal was served about 11 hours into the flight, though you can change the timing if you prefer. This was the full Singapore Airlines performance: satay, appetizer, main, dessert, cheese, chocolates, served with Charles Heidsieck champagne and a wide range of wines and cocktails. Everything I ate was delicious and beautifully presented.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If that sounds too gluttonous there's a "wellness" option designed by Canyon Ranch, thankfully the only page of the menu where the calories are printed next to the food. (Prawn ceviche appetizer, 207; braised pork, 368; and French apple frangipane tart, 152.)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>You can also order from a "refreshment" menu throughout the flight, with choices from noodles to Greek yogurt and granola parfait.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Singapore Airlines is known for the professionalism of its cabin crew and they didn't disappoint: They were thoughtful, warm and efficient. While the flights from now on will no doubt feature fewer crew members who are recognisable from the safety video and other airline branding, in dozens of experiences with the carrier, I have yet to have one where I would rate the service as poor.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>KEEPING BUSY</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>There are Wi-Fi and in-flight roaming options to get online, including "all you can eat" roaming data packages available to people on a phone plan with two big Singapore telecommunications providers. If you're planning to work on board, it's important to note that on the North Pacific route (which we took on the first flight) there's a WiFi blackout of about two hours 15 minutes, starting around the 11th hour. I also had issues connecting outside those times, as did other passengers nearby, though I can't say if that was due to the number of data-hungry journalists on board.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>For entertainment there's the airline's extensive selection of movies, TV shows and music, with an extra 200 hours of content for this flight. I wasn't jazzed about this month's movie selections (where was "Crazy Rich Asians"?), but with 130 titles in the "Hollywood and More" section alone, it seems ridiculous to complain.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Singapore Airlines doesn't usually give amenity kits, but for the first three months on this route, passengers get their selection of lip balm, hand cream, fabric spray and stain remover, which are offered after takeoff. Eye masks, socks and slippers are also given to each passenger and the usual business-class amenities (facial mist, toothbrushes etc.) are in the bathrooms. BLOOMBERG</p>

<p>Developers in the Republic sold 932 units, the Urban Redevelopment Authority said in a statement on Monday (Oct 15).</p>

<p>That compares with 617 units in August, the data show. Total apartments launched for sale last month more than doubled to 1,169.</p>

<p>Singapore private home prices are still inching higher â€” albeit at the slowest pace in five quarters.</p>

<p>An index tracking private residential prices increased 0.5 per cent in the three months ended Sept 30 versus a 3.4 per cent advance in the June quarter, according to a flash estimate from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) on Oct 1.</p>

<p>Singapore took renewed steps in July to cool the islandâ€™s property market after home prices rose more than 7 per cent in the first six months of the year.</p>

<p>A rush of transactions was fuelled by aggressive land bids from developers and so-called en-bloc transactions, which is where a group of owners band together to sell an entire apartment building.</p>

<p>Under the new rules, individuals taking out their first housing loan face stricter borrowing limits, meaning they have to stump up more cash upfront.</p>

<p>For foreign purchasers of residential property, the additional buyerâ€™s stamp duty was increased to 20 per cent from 15 per cent. For Singapore citizens, the extra charges only apply from their second home purchase.</p>

<p>Home prices on the island may rise as much as 10 per cent by the end of 2019 and are on track to double by 2030 as faster income growth overpowers the recent property curbs and higher interest rates, Morgan Stanley said last week.&nbsp;</p>

People around the world celebrate on this day, the significance of the oceans, which cover more than two-thirds of earthâ€™s surface and are the very foundations of life. The freediving demonstration is one of many activities organised by S.E.A. Aquarium to mark World Oceans Day as part of a 10-day conservation-themed festival to inspire visitors to protect the worldâ€™s oceans. Visitors to the aquarium from 17 to 26 June can also view Asiaâ€™s first World Oceans Day photo gallery, attend talks by aquarists, pledge their commitment to conservation at a photo pledge wall, and contribute to one of Singaporeâ€™s largest murals made up of tens of thousands of plastic bottle caps.

People around the world celebrate on this day, the significance of the oceans, which cover more than two-thirds of earthâ€™s surface and are the very foundations of life. The freediving demonstration is one of many activities organised by S.E.A. Aquarium to mark World Oceans Day as part of a 10-day conservation-themed festival to inspire visitors to protect the worldâ€™s oceans. Visitors to the aquarium from 17 to 26 June can also view Asiaâ€™s first World Oceans Day photo gallery, attend talks by aquarists, pledge their commitment to conservation at a photo pledge wall, and contribute to one of Singaporeâ€™s largest murals made up of tens of thousands of plastic bottle caps.

<p>In a<a href="https://www.catholic.sg/pastoral-letter-archbishop-s377a/">&nbsp;pastoral message addressed to the Catholic Church</a>, Most Reverend William Goh also spoke of his dilemma after receiving appeals from opposing camps to support their position, even as he appealed to all Catholics to â€œmake a conscientious decision to reject the repeal for the future of our families, humanity and societyâ€.</p>

<p>â€œIt is a delicate dilemma for any leader to have to negotiate. I feel trapped, just as Jesus must have felt when the Pharisees posed to Him the question of whether divorce was lawful, or whether it was lawful to pay taxes to the emperor,â€ he said.</p>

<p>The debate over Section 377A in Singapore was recently reignited by the Indian Supreme Courtâ€™s decision earlier this month to strike down a similar law. Since then, petitions have been started by activists on both sides of the divide, religious groups have weighed in, and a deejay has filed a fresh legal challenge.</p>

<p>In his message, where he also touched on the â€œmoral, social and legal implications of upholding or repealingâ€ Section 377A, Archbishop Goh said that by â€œaccepting homosexual acts as a social norm, the dreadful consequences for the stability of our families, the well-being of our children, and the risks to the common good will be long-term and irreversibleâ€.</p>

<p>He pointed out that he would not object to a repeal of Section 377A â€œif it were merely aimed at removing all potential criminal penalties against homosexualsâ€.</p>

<p>â€œHowever, until and unless Parliament puts in place a formulation that more perfectly encapsulates the spirit of the law, guaranteeing the protection of the rights of the majority who favour the traditional family, and that no further demands be made to legalise same-sex unions, same-sex adoption of babies, surrogacy, or to criminalise those who do not support the homosexual lifestyle, I am of the view that Section 377A should not be repealed under the present circumstances,â€ he said.</p>

<p>Commenting on the Indian court ruling, Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam told reporters last week that Singapore is â€œdeeply splitâ€ on the issue. While the majority oppose a repeal, a â€œgrowing minorityâ€ want it to be abolished, with the Government stuck in the middle.</p>

<p>Giving his personal views on the law for the first time, Mr Shanmugam said that when it comes to â€œpeople's lifestylesâ€¦ (and) sexual attitudesâ€¦ (we) really should be careful in treating them as criminal or criminalising thatâ€.</p>

<p>â€œBut again, it would be wrong for me to impose my personal views on society or as a policymaker,â€ he said. â€œSo I think, really, society has got to decide which direction it wants to go, and the laws will have to keep pace with changes in society and how society sees these issues.â€</p>

<p>Mr Shanmugam also reiterated that while the law is there, there have generally been no prosecutions for private conduct. â€œPeople openly express themselves as gay, I mean you have got the gay parade. Police even approved the licensing for it, no one gets prosecuted for declaring themselves as gay. So, really, when was the last time someone was prosecuted?â€ he said.</p>

<p>Education Minister Ong Ye Kung has also weighed in on the issue, stressing that there is no discrimination against the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community "at work, housing (and) education" in Singapore.</p>

<p>Echoing Mr Shanmugam's view that society has to decide on the direction, he added during a business conference on Friday: â€œWe might be the largest animal in the jungle, but we are not the jungle. Some things we leave it to society to decide over time."</p>

<p>â€˜A FINE LINEâ€™ &nbsp;</p>

<p>In his message, Archbishop Goh made it clear that right from the outset, â€œall the faithful are important to me, regardless whether they have same- or opposite-sex attractionâ€.</p>

<p>He added: â€œOn one hand, I feel the struggles and pains of those with same-sex attraction who sincerely love God and desire to live up to His divine plan for humanity. I feel with them when they are ostracised or marginalised by society. They, too, deserve to be loved and treated with dignity and respect.</p>

<p>â€œOn the other hand, I share the anxieties and fears of those who subscribe to the traditional and scriptural views of marriage and family, that repealing Section 377A would lead the country down a slippery slope. This is because repealing the law will not be the end of the saga. Rather, it would only embolden the push to legalise same-sex unions, same-sex adoption of babies, surrogacy, and even the criminalisation of those who hold contrary views of marriage and who oppose same-sex unions.â€</p>

<p>To transcend the legal issue, â€œwe must go beyond a legalistic interpretation of the lawâ€, he reiterated.</p>

<p>â€œWhat is important is to ask, what is the intention of Section 377A? Is it intended to penalise the homosexual by punishing him for sexual acts? Does this law run counter to the Holy Seeâ€™s condemnation of â€˜unjust discriminationâ€™ against homosexuals? The Church walks a fine line on this issue,â€ he noted.</p>

<p>While the Catholic Church joined with two-thirds of the United Nations member states in rejecting a proposal to decriminalise homosexuality in December 2008, it also urged them to eliminate criminal sanctions for homosexual behaviour. â€œIn other words, the Holy Seeâ€™s stance dovetails with that of the Singapore Government,â€ the archbishop pointed out.</p>

<p>He added: â€œClearly, the spirit of both the moral and civil laws is to emphasise that same-sex unions are not a social norm as they do not help to foster fruitful and life-giving marriages or cohesive families which are the bedrock of a strong and stable society.â€</p>

<p>This is also intended as a safeguard to prevent champions of â€œgay rightsâ€ from taking their cause beyond the mere repeal of Section 377A, he said.</p>

<p>Concluding his message,&nbsp;the leader of the Catholic Church in Singapore warned against following in the footsteps of some other countries. The website on which the message was published&nbsp;also carried&nbsp;a link to a petition to retain Section 377A, and the email address of government feedback unit Reach for people to express their support for the law.</p>

<p>Archbishop Goh said: â€œLooking at the dire consequences for countries which normalised same-sex unions and the ramifications that followed, may we not repeat the mistake that others have made. I pray that we will not walk the slippery path of no return."</p>
